# üèè T20 Score Predictor
Welcome to the T20 Score Predictor project! This web application predicts cricket scores using a machine learning model built with the XGBoost algorithm.

# üìã Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict scores for T20 cricket matches, one of the most exciting formats in the sport. With the growing popularity of T20 leagues worldwide, accurate score predictions can be a valuable tool for fans, analysts, and even players. The model is trained on historical data and incorporates various match-specific features to generate predictions.

# üìñ Detailed Description
The T20 Score Predictor uses advanced machine learning techniques to forecast the potential scores of T20 cricket matches. The model, built using the powerful XGBoost algorithm, analyzes various features such as team composition, past performance, and match conditions to provide accurate predictions.

## Model Training
The model was trained on extensive historical data, including various T20 matches from different leagues and international games. Key features considered during training include:

**Team Strength**: Historical performance metrics of the teams involved.
**Venue Details**: Ground dimensions, pitch type, and historical scores at the venue.
**Weather Conditions**: Impact of weather conditions on match outcomes.

## Model Serialization
The trained model is serialized using pickle and saved as pipe.pkl. This allows for easy loading and inference during runtime within the Flask application. The use of pickle ensures that the model can be seamlessly integrated and deployed in various environments.

## Web Application
The web application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. It provides an intuitive interface where users can input match details and receive score predictions. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, with dropdown menus for selecting teams, input fields for match specifics, and a clear display of the predicted score.

## User Interface
The front-end of the application is developed using HTML and CSS. The main page (index.html) allows users to enter match details, and the results are dynamically displayed based on the model's predictions. The static folder contains images for team logos and a CSS file (style.css) to style the application, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.

# üåê Technologies Used
**Python**: The core programming language used for model development and web application.
**Flask**: A micro web framework used to build the web application.
**XGBoost**: A powerful machine learning algorithm used for building the prediction model.
**HTML/CSS/Bootstrap**: For structuring and styling the web interface.
**JavaScript**: For enhancing user interactions on the web page.
